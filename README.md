This is a set of tools that I created during my work for the online shop retailer. It was meant to help me and fellow specialists in providing the business partners with results of some processes. Instead of searching for the data in slugish gsheets or excel files, the tool enabled automated analysis of csv files and producing ready-to-send files. I shared it in .exe file so no coding knowledge or environement was required.

How it worked:
An agent run the .exe file and faced the consol menu. The next step was to choose from the given option what to do. The agent was asked to download and put a csv file in the indicated folder, then specify some additional information if needed for filtering (like CW or partner's name). Finally a new, filtered, csv or excel file was created and it could have been sent to a partner.
